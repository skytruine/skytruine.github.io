Hi, I am Yifan, an independent developer&designer and a Ph.D. stu @Geography,UW studying the intertwined society and geographical misinformation. I got my bachelor & master degree at Wuhan University in GIS and used to worked for Bytedance as a full-stack data scientist. Currently, my research focus on conceptualize, investigate and develop sociotechnial solutions to controversial satellite imagery (i.e. AI-generated satellite imagery, competing interpretations) in and beyond mass media systems.

You can get my up-to-date cv [here](/file/Yifan_Sun_cv.pdf), and go through my past projects at [archived project](https://sunyifan.net/archive/?tag=archived+project).
