# 1. Introduction
&emsp;These are a series of planning and decision-making oriented comprehensive statistical analysis projects for geographical conditions, which come from related government departments such as bureau of surveying and mapping or urban planning institute. Their main content includes comprehensive analysis of geographical condition related content such as urban development, ecological security, and public services, and providing planning and decision-making advice to government departments based on the analysis results. So far, I have participated in three related projects and served as the general manager of two of them.
# 2. Main content 
## 2.1 Project of Tianjin 
&emsp;Based on the series of policies of geographic country data analysis application and informatization construction and the actual needs of Tianjin in the detection of geographical conditions, the project divides the comprehensive statistical analysis of geographical conditions into two sections: “construction land” and “basic public service”. The urban construction land planning management plays an irreplaceable role in the regulation of urbanization. Under the topic of “construction land use”, it contains three sub-themes of “Construction Land Expansion Topic”, “Urban Form Special Topic” and “Multi-Center Space System Topic”. The construction of urban public service system is an important embodiment of building a people-oriented harmonious society. Its material basis is public facilities. The scientific allocation and rational layout of public facilities is an important guarantee for fully satisfying people's cultural needs, realizing the fairness and efficiency of public cultural services, and promoting the healthy development of cities. Under the topic of “Basic Public Service”, it includes “Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Park Green Space”, “Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Medical Facilities”, “Evaluation of Education Equalization”, “Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Pension Facilities”, “Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Vegetable Market”, “ Walkable comprehensive statistical analysis of six sub-themes.

## 2.2 Project of Guangzhou
&emsp;The Guangzhou National Geographical Situation Monitoring Project is based on the latest third national census data. Its contents mainly include three major topics: ①construction land expansion topic; ②low-efficiency industrial land identification topic; ③underground space utilization topic.The core issue of the construction land expansion topic are: What is the current status of construction land expansion in Guangzhou? How to expand in the future? In order to solve these problems, we evaluate the expansion of construction land from five aspects: the strength, direction, type, construction land form and urban boundary identification of construction land, and further analyze the influencing factors of urban expansion and landscape. On this basis, we use adaptive integrated learning cellular automata to predict the future expansion of construction land in Guangzhou.The core questions of the inefficient industrial land identification topic are: How much is the inefficient industrial land in Guangzhou? How to optimize? And how do different types of development zones and industrial parks affect the efficiency of industrial land? In order to solve these problems, we use the comprehensive index method and the data envelopment method to measure the efficiency of industrial land, and further identify the inefficient industrial land through threshold segmentation and hotspot analysis, and use the optimization strategy matrix to give the inefficient industrial land optimization plan.The core issues of the underground space utilization topic answer are: What is the current status of underground space development in Guangzhou? What is the potential? In order to solve these problems, we evaluate the development status of underground space through three aspects: intensity, aggregation and form, and comprehensively measure the potential of underground space development from four aspects: social economic status, land use status, comprehensive development opportunities, and ecological environment constraints.

## 2.3 Project of Xiangyang
The space utilization monitoring of the development zone of the Xiangyang Development Zones utilizes the basic geographic information data, remote sensing image data, development zone statistics and various thematic data of the development zone of Xiyangyang to explore the status quo and trends of various types of construction land in development zones. Specifically, this part analyzes the scale and layout of land use in Xiangyang Development Zones from the aspects of the spatial pattern of the development zone, the scale of land use, the change of the central area and the allocation of public services.On the other hand, the safety monitoring of the downtown area of Xiangyang helps to identify potential pollution hazards and safety threats in the planning permit by monitoring and evaluating various pollution sources and various hazards in the downtown area of ​​Xiangyang.

# 3. Summary of my contributions

 - Obtained a large amount of traffic information and enterprise details using the crawler technology.
 - Expansion mode of construction land are analyzed from five aspects including intensity, direction, type, landscape and boundary, and cellular automata is further used to simulate and predict the future expansion of construction land.
 - Established 13 comprehensive models to assess the accessibility, supply and demand balance of fruit and vegetable markets, and provided optimization schemes with the employing of particle swarm algorithm.
 - Designed and conducted an analysis scheme of urban safety from the perspective of pollution and hazardous chemicals.
 - Designed a scheme for analyzing the utilization status of underground space and evaluating its development potential.
 # 4. Project and research
 On the one hand, these projects involve a large number of published articles in our laboratory; on the other hand, they promote the progress of our scientific research in terms of topic selection and data support.
