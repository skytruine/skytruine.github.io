# 1. Introduction
&emsp;After a long time of accumulation and product development, Urban Research Laboratory of Wuhan University has becom the top team in the field of national geographic census and monitoring. Theoretically, it not only puts forward a complete product system of geographical condition survey and monitoring map, but also puts forward the conceptual framework, design concept and expression mode of thematic map of geographical condition aided decision comprehensive analysis. In practice, it has cooperated with relevant departments in a large number of first-tier cities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing and Tianjin, and won unanimous praise. In the team, I systematically studied the product system of the census and monitoring map of geographical conditions and the thematic map drawing theory of the aided decision-making of geographical conditions, and independently produced a series of thematic maps.

## 2.1 Research on Map Products System of Geographical Conditions Census and Monitoring 
&emsp;With the completion of the First Geographical Conditions Census, a large volume of national geographical data (NGD) have been collected and there is a pressing need for map products to represent the total conditions of these data. However, because of the lack of map products system, units of surveying and mapping have no sufficient guidance for production of NGD and result in providing little necessary services for governors, enterprises and public. In this paper, a whole set of map products system for NGD was presented based on map production. Using this system, a series of detailed guidance can be obtained by related units to improve current map production efficiency on NGD. Moreover, a logical framework of online NGD maps production system was proposed to improve the efficiency of thematic maps production. This system was put into application and had achieved good results.

## 2.2 Thematic map design
This paper puts forward the conceptual framework and design the concept of decision supporting the analysis map
based on geographiccensus, and elaborates its theme selection, representation and symbol and color design. Finally, Wuhan City Map is compiled as an example.
