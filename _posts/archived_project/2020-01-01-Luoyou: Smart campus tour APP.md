# 1. Summary
&emsp;Based on the Official Map System of Wuhan University (http://map.whu.edu.cn/), I led a team of ten people to further develop Luyou, an official mobile map APP with functions such as map search, panoramic roaming, and voice navigation. In the process of product development, I not only control the overall situation, but also directly participate in the server-side development and UE design. Besides, in the process of developing Luoyou, I set up cartovision studio and its affiliated student associations (http://www.cartovision.cn) to provide supporting services for GIS systems of Wuhan University. Up to now, the team has grown to nearly 100 people and become an independent student organization integrating development, operation and maintenance, competition and scientific research.
